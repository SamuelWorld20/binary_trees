## Introduction

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This repository aims to provide resources for understanding the principles, types, and operations related to binary trees.

## Binary Tree Basics

In this section, we cover fundamental concepts of binary trees, including terminology, properties, and basic operations.

- **Terminology**: Explanation of common terms such as nodes, leaves, root, parent, child, etc.
- **Properties**: Understanding the characteristics that define binary trees.
- **Basic Operations**: Overview of essential binary tree operations like insertion and deletion.

## Types of Binary Trees

Explore different types of binary trees, each with unique characteristics and use cases:

- **Full Binary Trees**: Definition and properties of full binary trees.
- **Complete Binary Trees**: Understanding complete binary trees and their applications.
- **Perfect Binary Trees**: Characteristics and properties of perfect binary trees.
- **Balanced Binary Trees**: Introduction to balanced trees for optimized performance.

## Binary Tree Traversal

Learn about the various methods for traversing binary trees to access and process nodes:

- **Inorder Traversal**: Visit left subtree, current node, right subtree.
- **Preorder Traversal**: Visit current node, left subtree, right subtree.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Visit left subtree, right subtree, current node.

## Binary Tree Operations

Dive into common operations performed on binary trees, such as searching, insertion, and deletion:

- **Search Operation**: Locating a specific value within the binary tree.
- **Insertion Operation**: Adding a new node to the tree.
- **Deletion Operation**: Removing a node from the tree.

## Balanced Binary Trees

Understand the importance of balanced binary trees and explore self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees:

- **AVL Trees**: Overview and principles of AVL trees.
- **Rotations**: Understanding rotations in AVL trees for balancing.

## Sample Code

Sample implementations and code snippets are provided to help you grasp the practical aspects of working with binary trees. Check the `src/` directory for code examples.
